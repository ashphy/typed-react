# Typed React - Concept Document

## Philosophy

### Learning Through Types

When writing React with TypeScript, many beginners hit a wall with "I don't know how to write types." This site prioritizes **understanding the type system**, providing educational materials that progress from the fundamentals of the type system to practical type definitions for React components.

### Practice-Oriented

Beyond theory, we address real typing challenges encountered in actual React development. We focus on practical knowledge used in production: Props, State, Hooks, event handlers, Context, and more.

### Beginner-Friendly

Structured for those new to TypeScript or React to learn from the ground up. Technical terms are explained carefully, and understanding is supported through abundant code examples.

## What This Site Covers

### 1. TypeScript Type System Fundamentals
- Primitive types (string, number, boolean, etc.)
- Object types and interfaces
- Arrays and tuples
- Union and intersection types
- Literal types
- Type aliases vs interfaces
- Generics
- Utility types (Partial, Pick, Omit, etc.)

### 2. Typing React Components
- Function component types
- Props type definitions
- Children types
- Event handler types
- State types (useState type inference)
- Ref and useRef types
- Context type definitions
- Custom hook types

### 3. Practical Patterns
- Reusing component types
- Type-safe form handling
- API response type definitions
- Conditional rendering with types
- Type guards
- as const and readonly
- Type narrowing

### 4. Common Errors and Solutions
- Reading type errors
- Avoiding `any`
- Resolving type mismatches
- Handling nullable values
- When to use type assertions

## What This Site Does NOT Cover

### Out of Scope Topics
- JavaScript basic syntax (variables, functions, arrays, etc.)
- React basic concepts (what is a component, etc.)
- Build tools and bundler configuration
- CSS and styling
- Testing
- State management libraries (Redux, Zustand, etc.)
- React performance optimization
- Framework-specific content (Next.js, Remix, etc.)

By delegating these topics to other excellent resources and **focusing specifically on types and TypeScript**, we aim to create a site where you can learn more deeply.

## Target Audience

### Intended Readers
- Understand JavaScript basics
- Know fundamental React concepts (components, Props, State)
- New to TypeScript, or only use basic types
- Feel "I don't know how to write types"
- Don't know how to resolve type errors

### Learning Goals
- Understand and appropriately use TypeScript's type system
- Correctly define types in React components
- Read and independently resolve type errors
- Develop efficiently using IDE type completion
- Reduce bugs by writing type-safe code

## Site Structure

### Learning Flow
1. **Fundamentals**: Understand the basics of TypeScript's type system
2. **React**: Learn practical ways to use types in React components
3. **Practice**: Learn advanced type usage and common problem-solving techniques

### Content Features
- **Progressive learning**: Deepen understanding from basics to advanced topics
- **Abundant code examples**: Concrete understanding through working code
- **Practice-oriented**: Prioritize knowledge usable in actual development
- **Error explanations**: Carefully explain common errors and their solutions

## Summary

Typed React is a practical learning site for TypeScript beginners to become React engineers who "don't struggle with types." By deepening your understanding of types, you'll be able to develop safer and more maintainable React applications.
